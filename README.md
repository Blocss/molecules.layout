# Blocss Layout â€“ v0.0.0

A [Blocss](https://github.com/Blocss/blocss/) component for a CSS layout system. Layout makes use of `flexbox` and
`box-sizing` to provide features that float-based layouts cannot.

**N.B.** This component relies on particular dimensions being applied to cells in
the grid via other classes. For example the [Blocss dimensions](https://github.com/Blocss/dimensions/) extension.
